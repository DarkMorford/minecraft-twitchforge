# Please Wait...

## Overview

Please Wait is a mod for Minecraft that provides integration with twitch.tv.
The mod monitors a Twitch channel at a configurable interval (by default 5
minutes) and affects the game world according to the information available
about that channel. For example, when it notices that the channel has started
streaming (i.e., transitioned from offline to online) it will post a message
to the in-game chat notifying players about the new stream.

## Configuration

### General

* **twitchChannel** - The name of the Twitch channel you want to monitor. (Default: minecraft)
* **updateInterval** - How often to check the channel for new information, in minutes. (Default: 5)
